The Splash Screen is the initial screen that users see when they open the Recipe Finder Mobile Application. It features the application's logo centrally placed, along with a vibrant background that gives a hint of the food-related nature of the app. This screen lasts for a few seconds while the application is loading, providing an engaging first impression for the user. Its purpose is to improve user experience by providing visual feedback during app startup, and to reinforce branding by displaying our logo.  

### 2. Main Screen
<p width="100%"><img width="20%" src="https://github.com/akdenizcse/23b-cse234-term-project-ancalpar/assets/71456529/0770a225-24f0-41d1-8ca3-e2b7a0ff3584"></p>  
The Main Screen of the Recipe Finder Mobile Application is presented to users following the Splash Screen. This screen provides two options for users to proceed within the application:  

**Login**: This button leads to the Login Screen where users can securely log into the application using their registered email and password. Logging in gives you access to personalized features such as saving favorite recipes, commenting and rating recipes.  
**Continue Without Login**: This button allows users to use the application without logging in. It is designed for users who want to quickly browse or search recipes without the need to register or log in. While this option provides immediate access to a wide range of recipes, it comes with limited features - for example, users won't be able to save favorite recipes, make comments or rate them.  

This screen design caters to both types of users - those who desire a personalized experience, and those who wish to browse the app casually without logging in. This approach ensures a versatile and inclusive user experience.  

### 3. Visitor Screen

Each recipe card includes a thumbnail image of the dish, its name, cooking time, and a brief summary. Users can tap on any recipe card to access more comprehensive details about that recipe, including the required ingredients and step-by-step cooking instructions.

While the Visitor Screen provides users with access to a vast database of recipes, certain functionalities are limited to logged-in users. For instance, users browsing the app without logging in won't have the ability to save their favorite recipes for future reference or contribute to the community by rating or commenting on the recipes.

The Visitor Screen is designed to deliver a hassle-free recipe browsing and searching experience for casual users or those preferring not to log in.
